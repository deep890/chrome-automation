# chrome-automation
in this repository, i am letting the computer open up chrome, go to some xyz website, type in stuff an hit enter.
what we will require :
a) selenium
b) chromedriver
for selenium just install it in The terminal by pip install selenium 
for more refrences - https://www.selenium.dev/
now we need chrome driver to deal with chrome, go to https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
if you don't know the chrome version you're using then go to chrome and type in "chrome://version"
for more you can have my youtube tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O_5KeX5wBc&t=8s
